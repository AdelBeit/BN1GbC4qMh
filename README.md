# Website for Ideal Auto

This website was made for a local auto repair shop to help them grow, besides this I also helped them find and acquire a credit card reader as well as listing them on google maps and registering them for google business. Overall it made them more visible for customers and allowed them a space to be recognized through on google reviews, on which they have a high rating right now.

It's fully customized, artisan, fresh outta the oven JS, HTML, and CSS code. Uses Bootstrap, and jQuery. You can also find a hand crafted lightbox and a JS generator to generate a cars table based on JSON data, since it's a static website I never got to add a backend to allow uploading and adding new cars, so they have to be manually added to the JSON sheet. It's also 100% responsive with all device sizes. Give it a whirl!

Later on, I decided to switch to Wix as I felt the overall look of the first verison was underwhelming, Wix just had better color schemes.
